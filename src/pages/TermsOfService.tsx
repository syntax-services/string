                            String is a platform that connects local businesses with customers and supports discovery, communication, payments, and transaction coordination. For qualifying transactions, String may serve as the marketplace intermediary and escrow-style payment layer through approved payment partners until applicable release conditions, verification checks, or delivery milestones are satisfied.

                            Payments are processed through our partner Squad. String may charge service fees or commissions on transactions as disclosed at the point of sale. Where String is facilitating an escrow-style flow, payouts, releases, reversals, reviews, or holds may be delayed while we complete fraud checks, delivery confirmation, dispute review, compliance review, or other safety processes. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise required by law.
